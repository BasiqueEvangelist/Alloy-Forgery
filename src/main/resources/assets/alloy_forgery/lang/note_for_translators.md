The first line `"alloy_forgery.forge_controller_name_pattern": "{type} {name}"` in the language file defines how the name of any given Forge Controller is assembled. Change this if the language that is being translated to has different grammar rules.

For Example `"{name} made of {type}"` would become "Forge Controller made of Blackstone"
